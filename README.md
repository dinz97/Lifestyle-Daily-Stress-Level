## Installation
Only standard libraries that came from Anaconda distribution of Python were used to run the code as listed below:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Scipy

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using Lifestyle and Wellbeing survey response to better understand:
1. At what age people experience high daily stress level?
2. How is the lifestyle of person with high daily stress level?
3. Is there any correlation between stress level and life achievements satifaction?

## File Descriptions
There are 1 data file and 1 Jupyter notebook available to showcase work related to the above questions.
* Wellbeing_and_lifestyle_data_Kaggle.csv: This dataset contains 15,977 survey responses with 24 attributes describing how respondents live their lives.
* Lifestyle&DailyStressLevel: Jupyter Notebook to prepare data and perform analysis.

The notebook contains data exploration to answer questions mentioned above. Markdown cells were used to guide the thought process of the analysis.

## Results
Summary of the key findings:
1. Age group 36 to 50 has the highest proportion of high daily stress level.

3. There is a weak correlation between stress and satisfaction in life achievements. Stress potentially can motivate someone to achieve more in their lives.
