## Installation
Only standard libraries that came from Anaconda distribution of Python were used to run the code as listed below:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Scipy

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using Lifestyle and Wellbeing survey response to better understand:
1. At what age people experience high stress level?
2. How is the lifestyle of person with high stress level?
3. Is there any correlation between stress level and life achievements?

## File Descriptions
There are 1 data file and 1 Jupyter notebook available to showcase work related to the above questions.
* Wellbeing_and_lifestyle_data_Kaggle.csv: This dataset contains 15,977 survey responses with 24 attributes describing how respondents live their lives.
* Lifestyle&DailyStressLevel: Jupyter Notebook to prepare data and perform analysis.

The notebook contains data exploration to answer questions mentioned above. Markdown cells were used to guide the thought process of the analysis.

## Results
Summary of the key findings:
1. Age group 36 to 50 has the highest proportion of high daily stress level.
